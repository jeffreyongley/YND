# YND

# Inspiration

- The inspiration for this project came from The Money Guys Youtube Channel
- They have a ystem called the Financial order of operations or FOO that can be used to decide where to spend your next dollar to have the best impact on your financial future.
- I wanted to create a simple app to start where I could insert my financial data and recieve recomendations based off the FOO for what to do with my money
- As an example If I recieved a paycheck for $2500 It might return Rent $1000 Spending $500 RothIRA $500 Brokerage account $1000
- This ReadMe will serve as a list of updates and a summarry for the project as I build it out.
